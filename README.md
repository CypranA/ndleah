### Hi there,  I'm Leah Nguyen :wave:

- :hammer_and_wrench: I live to solve problems using analytics!

- :bar_chart: For me, data analysis is a way to identify a pattern, to detect a key problem among outliers and to tell a valuable story to make an impact.

- :writing_hand: I spent hours to learn SQL, Python, Google Analytics, and visualisation tools such as Power BI, Tableau and Data Studio.

- :sparkles: My greatest passion: using Data Visualisation to tell story within data and derive insights for business success.
